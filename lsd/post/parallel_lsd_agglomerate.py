    '''Agglomerate fragments in parallel using only the shape descriptors.

    Args:

        lsds (`class:daisy.Array`):

            An array containing the LSDs.

        fragments (`class:daisy.Array`):

            An array containing fragments.

        rag_provider (`class:SharedRagProvider`):

            A RAG provider to read nodes from and write found edges to.

        lsd_extractor (``LsdExtractor``):

            The local shape descriptor object used to compute the difference
            between the segmentation and the target LSDs.

        block_size (``tuple`` of ``int``):

            The size of the blocks to process in parallel, in world units.

        context (``tuple`` of ``int``):

            The context to consider for agglomeration, in world units.

        num_workers (``int``):

            The number of parallel workers.

    Returns:

        True, if all tasks succeeded.
